        <h1>Tolosa Ramirez, Gabriela</h1>
        <p> I was born in Colombia and have lived in the United States for 11 years now.
            I speak Spanish, English and am paritally proficient in Japanese. I was in marching
            band and had an internship at an animal hospital throughout my senior year of high school.
            I am currently a Sophomore at CU Boulder and am studying computer science because
            I enjoy the challenge of solving a puzzle. My interest rose when I took AP Comp Sci in high school.
